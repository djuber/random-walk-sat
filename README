Implement Schonings Random Walk for SAT.

I reused most of the data structure from the divide and conquer program.
This allowed readfile.cc to remain essentially unchanged.

Schonings algorithm does not need recursion, so no 
attempt at sharing structure has been made. 

The number of random initializations required by the program is insanely large:
 for 20 variables it is 86545
for 50 variables it is 765675058
for 75 variables it is 1245337617363
for 125 variables it is 2835341908750583808


The data structure choices made earlier have come back to haunt me.
I eliminated the clause length field from the problem,
seeing as it wasn't used in checking for satisfaction, but now
traverse a clause twice to get a random variable.
